Using height map data from the [HiRISE Project](http://www.uahirise.org/anaglyph/), the 3D [scanned](http://www.agisoft.com/) sculptures by [Alys Jenkins](http://www.alysjenkins.com/) would be hundreds of feet tall.

Who is to say there weren't such edifices and the solar system wasn't once a gyre.
